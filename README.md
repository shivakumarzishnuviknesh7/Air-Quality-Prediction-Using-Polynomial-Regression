This project could involve predicting air quality metrics, such as PM2.5 concentration, based on various environmental factors like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and weather conditions. You can collect historical air quality data from different monitoring stations and weather data from relevant sources. Then, you can preprocess the data, apply polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships, and train a model to predict air quality levels. Finally, evaluate the model's performance and visualize the predictions to gain insights into air quality patterns.
